# Facilities

You are welcome to use the kitchen area, but please clean up after yourself and keep the surfaces clear.

We have a shower room, but we do not recommend using it until we get the ventiliation fixed.

We have one loo. Hopefully it will be enough, but this space is now shared between over 30 people, so it will get well used.
