# How do we intend to fund ourselves?

The short answer is, *We don't know*.

The longer answer is that we are trying different things and we expect one or more of them will eventually work. These include:

1. Finding work for our graduates and taking a proportion of the fees they earn from clients;

1. Acting as a recuitment agency for our graduates and taking fees from employers;

1. Developing training courses that we can charge for;

1. Accepting commercial sponsorship;

1. Applying for public funds;

1. Asking for support from successful alumni.


Please let us help you find work before you start looking yourself. If you see a job you like the look of, please let us contact the employer on your behalf.
