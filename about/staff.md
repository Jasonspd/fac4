This is the most exciting change to the course this time. The first four versions of this course were taught more-or-less solo by Dan with a bit of invited help from outside speakers.

This time we have about 15 graduates from previous cohorts and two mentors who contributed to the last course all working on-site. They will all be helping with the course in some capacity and you will probably get to know all of them.
